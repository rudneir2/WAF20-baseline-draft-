# WAF20 Baseline (draft)
It is intended to be part of the chapter "Estabilish a baseline" from WAF 20 draft article

## Common IT environment used as a baseline
WAF Security is based on Zero Trust pillars to help companies to identify and group resources of the same type together and additionally understand how Azure security solutions may be applied as recommendations for different types of resources to have your environment secure.

Network, Infrastructure, Endpoint, Application, Data and Identity are the pillars considered in this baseline and it will be also used to demonstrate how a common IT environment may be securily protected.

The below diagram will be used as a reference throughout the Recommendations provided in this WAF Security documentation, so you may easily identify how to associate WAF security recommendations with specific resources, then how to apply them in your own environment.
